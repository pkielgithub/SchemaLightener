       Purpose: Used to request processing of the AssessmentReport noun by a receiving application or party.  

       AssessmentReport  Provides scores and other details to fulfill or respond to an assessment order. 

       Process is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. XPath is the default expression language. The actionCode attribute (Add, Change, Delete,   
       Replace) specifies the action to be taken by the receiver. The data entities being managed   
       are represented as elements of the AssessmentReport noun in the BOD instance.
