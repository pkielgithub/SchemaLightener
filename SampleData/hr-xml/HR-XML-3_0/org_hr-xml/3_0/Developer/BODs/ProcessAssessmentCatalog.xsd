       Status:  
       Date this version: 2009-01-08 
       Purpose: Used to request processing of the AssessmentCatalog noun by a receiving application or party.  

       AssessmentCatalog  Contains a set of information about assessment services or tests available to a customer. Enables the discovery of &quot;Package IDs&quot; which are necessary to place an order using HR-XML's assessment order specification. A &quot;Package&quot; may consist of one or more assessment instruments. An &quot;assessment package&quot; is the marketable unit of assessment or testing services that may be ordered. 

       Process is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. XPath is the default expression language. The actionCode attribute (Add, Change, Delete,   
       Replace) specifies the action to be taken by the receiver. The data entities being managed   
       are represented as elements of the AssessmentCatalog noun in the BOD instance.
