       Purpose: Used to request processing of the AssessmentOrder noun by a receiving application or party.  

       AssessmentOrder  Defines a set of information necessary to execute an order for an employment test or assessment. 

       Process is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. XPath is the default expression language. The actionCode attribute (Add, Change, Delete,   
       Replace) specifies the action to be taken by the receiver. The data entities being managed   
       are represented as elements of the AssessmentOrder noun in the BOD instance.
